				<h2>JStoList - help</h2>
				<p>This Javascript todo list makes organizing tasks easier!</p>
				<p>You will be able to sort your tasks in different areas, depending on their importance and urgency, according to the Eisenhower Matrix model.</p>
				<p>To add a task, click the <code>+</code> button in the desired area. You will be able to edit it by typing in the created block. You can also edit previous blocks.</p>
				<p>You can drag and drop blocks into different areas. To do this, you must double click on a block to select it, then click once again to drop it.</p>
				<p>You can reorder blocks inside a certain area by selecting and placing a block you want to be put first. To delete a block, click it using the right or middle button.</p>
				<p>Your data is safely saved in local storage, hence clearing browser data will also erase your data on this website.</p>
				<p>You can export the content of the page if necessary, for example to export them to another device. To do that, you can also import a pre-exported file.</p>

				<h2>Importing files - disclaimer</h2>
				<p>You should only consider importing files that were generated by this website. If you upload another type of file, its content may not be interpreted correctly.</p>
				<p>When you import a file, the auto-save triggers. If you import a file that was not treated correctly, you might lose your previous blocks, so be careful when importing and make regular backups just in case.</p>
