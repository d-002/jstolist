Javascript Todo list

This Javascript todo list makes organizing tasks easier!

You will be able to sort your tasks in different areas, depending on their importance and urgency, according to the Eisenhower Matrix model.

To add a task, click the + button in your desired area. You will be able to edit it by typing in the created block. You can also edit previous blocks.

You can drag and drop blocks into different areas. To do this, you must click once to select a block, then once again to drop it.

You can reorder blocks inside a certain area by selecting and placing a block you want to be put first. To delete a block, double-click it.

Your data is safely saved in local storage, though by erasing it you will also erase your data.

You can export the content of the page if necessary, for example to export them to another device. To do that, you can also import a pre-exported file.
